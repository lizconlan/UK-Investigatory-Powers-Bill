Bulk interception warrants

106 Bulk interception warrants

(1) For the purposes of this Act a "bulk interception warrant" is a warrant issued under this Chapter which meets conditions A and B.

(2) Condition A is that the main purpose of the warrant is one or more of the following-

	(b) the obtaining of related communications data from such communications (see subsection (6)).

(3) In this Chapter "overseas-related communications" means-
	(a) communications sent by individuals who are outside the British Islands, or 25 (b) communications received by individuals who are outside the British Islands. (4) Condition B is that the warrant authorises or requires the person to whom it is addressed to secure, by any conduct described in the warrant, any one or more of the following activities-
	(a) the interception, in the course of their transmission by means of a telecommunication system, of communications described in the warrant;
	(b) the obtaining of related communications data from communications described in the warrant; 35
	(c) the selection for examination, in any manner described in the warrant, of intercepted material or related communications data obtained under the warrant;
	(d) the disclosure, in any manner described in the warrant, of such material or data to the person to whom the warrant is addressed or to any person acting on that person's behalf.

(5) A bulk interception warrant also authorises the following conduct
(in addition to the conduct described in the warrant)-
	(a) any conduct which it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is expressly authorised or required by the warrant, including-
		(i) the interception of communications not described in the warrant, and
		(ii) conduct for obtaining related communications data from such communications;
	(b) conduct by any person which is conduct in pursuance of a requirement imposed by or on behalf of the person to whom the warrant is addressed to be provided with assistance in giving effect to the warrant.

(6) In this Chapter "related communications data", in relation to a communication transmitted by means of a telecommunication system, means data falling within subsection (7) or (8).

(7) The data falling within this subsection is so much of any data as is obtained while the communication is being transmitted, or at any time when the communication is stored in or by the system (whether before or after its transmission), and-
	(a) is communications data (see section 193(5)) relating to the communication or to the sender or recipient, or intended recipient, of the communication, or
	(b) is comprised in, included as part of, attached to or logically associated with the communication (whether by the sender or otherwise) and enables or otherwise facilitates the functioning of-
		(i) a telecommunication system
(including any apparatus forming part of the system), or
		(ii) any telecommunications service provided by means of a telecommunication system.

(8) The data falling within this subsection is so much of the content of the communication (see section 193(6)) as-
	(a) is capable of being logically separated from the remainder of the content of the communication, and
	(b) if it were so separated-
		(i) would not reveal anything of what might reasonably be expected to be the meaning of the communication, disregarding any meaning arising from the fact of the communication or from any data relating to the transmission of the communication, and
		(ii) would be data falling within subsection (9).

(9) The data falling within this subsection is-
	(a) data which may be used to identify, or assist in identifying, any person, apparatus, telecommunication system or telecommunications service, and
	(b) data which describes an event or the location of any person, event or thing.

107 Power to issue bulk interception warrants

	(b) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom so far as those interests are also relevant to the interests of national security (but see subsection (3)).

(3) A warrant may be considered necessary on the ground falling within subsection (2) (b) only if the information which it is considered necessary to obtain is information relating to the acts or intentions of persons outside the British Islands.

(4) A warrant may not be considered necessary in the interests of national security or on any other grounds falling within subsection (2) if it is considered necessary only for the purpose of gathering evidence for use in any legal proceedings.

(3) The selection conditions referred to in subsection (1) (c) are-
	(a) that the selection of the protected material for examination does not breach the prohibition in subsection (4);
	(b) that the person to whom the warrant is addressed reasonably considers that the selection of the protected material for examination would not breach that prohibition;
	(c) that the selection of the protected material for examination in breach of that prohibition is authorised by subsection (5);
	(d) that a targeted examination warrant has been issued under Part 5 authorising the examination of the protected material.

(4) The prohibition referred to in subsection (3) (a) is that the protected material may not at any time be selected for examination if-
	(a) any criteria used for the selection of the material for examination are referable to an individual known to be in the British Islands at that time, and
	(b) the purpose of using those criteria is to identify the content of communications sent by, or intended for, that individual or the content of private information relating to that individual. It does not matter for the purposes of this subsection whether the identity of the individual is known.

(5) The selection of protected material ("the relevant material") for examination is authorised by this subsection if-
	(a) criteria referable to an individual have been, or are being, used for the selection of material for examination in circumstances falling within subsection (3) (a) or (b),
	(b) at any time it appears to the person to whom the warrant is addressed that there has been a relevant change of circumstances in relation to the individual (see subsection (6)) which would mean that the selection of the relevant material for examination would breach the prohibition in subsection (4),
	(c) since that time, a written authorisation to examine the relevant material using those criteria has been given by a senior official, and
	(d) the selection of the relevant material for examination is made before the end of the permitted period (see subsection (7)).

(6) For the purposes of subsection (5) (b) there is a relevant change of circumstances in relation to an individual if-
	(a) the individual has entered the British Islands, or
	(b) a belief by the person to whom the warrant is addressed that the individual was outside the British Islands was in fact mistaken.

(7) In subsection (5), "the permitted period" means the period ending with the fifth working day after the time mentioned in subsection (5) (b).

(8) In this section, "protected material" means any material obtained under the warrant other than-
	(a) equipment data, or
	(b) information connected with the equipment to which the warrant relates but that is not a communication, private information or equipment data.

148 Application of other restrictions in relation to warrants under this Chapter Section 102 (offence of making unauthorised disclosure) applies in relation to bulk equipment interference warrants as it applies in relation to targeted equipment interference warrants.
