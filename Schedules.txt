(6) The fact that a retention notice under section 1 of the Act of 2014 has, in relation to a particular description of data and a particular operator (or description of operators), ceased to have effect or been revoked does not prevent the giving of a retention notice under section 78 of this Act in relation to the same description of data and the same operator (or description of operators).

(7) In this paragraph “the commencement day” is the day on which section 1(1)
of the Act of 2014 is repealed.

8 Nothing in any of the provisions of this Act by virtue of which conduct of any description is or may be authorised by any warrant, authorisation or
notice, or by virtue of which information may be obtained in any manner, is to be read—
